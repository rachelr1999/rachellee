summary: My research seeks to determine precise distances to galactic supernova
  remnants (SNR) by using parallax measurements of stars obtained from the GAIA
  2Â  data release. I have chosen candidates for spectroscopic observation that
  are of appropriate magnitude and are the most likely to be located behind the
  ejecta from the supernova. I will examine high-resolution spectra of these
  stars in order to identify possible Na ID and Ca H&K absorption features
  associated with the cold gas of the SNR. Using these spectra, I am then able
  to conclude that distance to the remnant based on the distances to the stars
  that present appropriate absorption features. Observations for the Crab Nebula
  and SN 3C-58 were conducted on the WIYN 3.5m telescope in the 2021A semester
  using the newly comissioned NEID instrument. We are also applying for
  additional observing time on the Gemini 8m telescope.
