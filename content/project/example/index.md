summary: My research seeks to determine precise distances to galactic supernova
  remnants (SNR) by using parallax measurements of stars obtained from the GAIA
  2Â  data release. I have chosen candidates for spectroscopic observation that
  are of appropriate magnitude and are the most likely to be located behind the
  ejecta from the supernova. I will examine high-resolution spectra of these
  stars in order to identify possible Na I and Ca II absorption features
  associated with the cold gas of the SNR. I will then conclude the location of
  the stars relative to the SNR based on the presence and intensity of
  absorption features. This research has inspired proposals for high resolution
  spectroscopic observations; Dr. Milisavljevic and I have been approved for the
  newly commissioned NEID instrument on the WIYN 3.5m telescope. We are also
  applying for additional observing time on the Gemini 8m telescope.
  Additionally, I have become accustomed to comparing Chandra X-Ray images to
  optical images and determining which candidates are the most advantageous for
  spectroscopic observation.
