My research seeks to determine precise distances to galactic supernova remnants (SNR) by using parallax measurements of stars obtained from the GAIA 2Â  data release. I have chosen candidates for spectroscopic observation that are of appropriate magnitude and are the most likely to be located behind the ejecta from the supernova. I will examine high-resolution spectra of these stars in order to identify possible Na I and Ca II absorption features associated with the cold gas of the SNR. I will then conclude the location of the stars relative to the SNR based on the presence and intensity of absorption features. This research has inspired proposals for high resolution spectroscopic observations; Dr. Milisavljevic and I have been approved for the newly commissioned NEID instrument on the WIYN 3.5m telescope. We are also applying for additional observing time on the Gemini 8m telescope. Additionally, I have become accustomed to comparing Chandra X-Ray images to optical images and determining which candidates are the most advantageous for spectroscopic observation.
