title: "REFITT (Recommender Engine for Intelligent Transient Tracking) "
date: 2021-06-25T19:09:34.122Z
summary: The goal of this project is to coordinate professional and amateur
  astronomers on a global scale as a method of performing time-sensitive
  observations of astronomical transients. REFITT is the first AI engine with
  the capabilities of providing advantageous observation recommendations in a
  timely manner. It utilizes a weighted analysis of capabilities, costs, and
  benefits of a diverse range of telescope, instruments, and locations within
  its network. My work on this project is to analyze and compare REFITT data to
  actual photometric observations in a mission to make REFITT as efficient and
  accurate as possible as it is in it's early stages.
