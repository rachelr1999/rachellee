summary: The goal of this project is to coordinate professional and amateur
  astronomers globally to perform time-sensitive observations of astronomical
  transients. REFITT is the world's first AI engine with the capabilities to
  provide advantageous observation recommendations in a timely manner. It
  utilizes weighted analysis of capabilities, costs, and benefits of a diverse
  range of telescope, instruments, and locations within its network. My work on
  this project is to analyze and compare REFITT data to actual photometric
  observations in a mission to make REFITT as efficient and accurate as
  possible.
