title: "REFITT (Recommender Engine for Intelligent Transient Tracking) "

summary: The goal of this project is to coordinate professional and amateur
  astronomers on a global scale as a method of performing time-sensitive
  observations of astronomical transients. REFITT utilizes a weighted analysis
  benefits and properties assocaited with a diverse range of telescope,
  instruments, and locations within its network. My work on this project is to
  analyze and compare REFITT data to actual photometric observations in a
  mission to make REFITT as efficient and accurate as possible as it is in it's
  early stages. Secondly, I created a complete list of possible galactic
  supernova candidates as important target stars for REFITT observing.
  Additionally, I created an exhaustive list of observatories and amateur
  astronomers worldwide as our method for outreach. Lastly, I provided an
  analysis of weather and climate patterns in high priority locations such as
  Kitt Peak in Arizona.
