        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Obtain and analyze data from Gaia Space Observatory to create documentation of stellar source candidates for spectroscopic analysis in order to determine locations of stars relative to a supernova remnant.
        * Compare Chandra X-Ray images to optical images to determine which candidates will result in the most advantageous spectroscopic observations.
        *Create and collaborate on observational proposals for usage of Gemini Telescopes and GMOS for multi-slit spectroscopy as well as the newly commissioned NEID instrument on the WIYN 3.5m telescope.
        * Compile, manage, and analyze multi-slit spectroscopy data of stars for the presence of absorption features.
        * Assist in developing a platform to coordinate ground-based facilities and follow up transients discovered by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).
        * Create and maintain a master list of optical observatories across the world.
        * Read and chart weather data from locations across the world to provide information about probable observational capabilities.
        * Compile galactic supernova candidate information.
        * Present research findings at laboratory meetings and to astrophysics students
        * Review and synthesize literature to advance my research.
        * Collaborate with team members and act in a leadership role with junior research assistants
